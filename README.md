**1.	INTRODUCTION:**

	The purpose is to develop this site is basically provide brief information of forts in India.
	The aim to design and develop the project is to provide detailed information about ‗forts in India and everyone can able to access information easily. It starts with a simple look where visitor has to choose their perfective through which they will continue into the website.
	
Whenever we think about Maharashtra forts so the first image is comes in our mind that is Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and their forts. There are more than 350 forts in Maharashtra and though some are not in great condition, many of these are located on top of mountains and have a magnificent architecture and topography. Almost all these forts are connected to history as many were connected to history as many were either built by Chhatrapati Shivaji or capture by him. A walk through these forts is a walk through history. This website is created mainly from the point of view of trekkers„ and forts lover .My website is based on the history of Maharashtra on the era of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaja. In this project we mention all history of each Fort. And also gives the information of Kings who reign of that forts in the past history.
Website is created such that everyone should be able to access the information properly and efficiently. It starts as with simple look where user has to visit the website the total information is available in Maharashtra Forts.
		Starting with the first page of my project which is the startup page of the project which is then followed by the forts and how many forts are in Maharashtra and some images are shown in Maharashtra as Raigad, Rajgad , Shivneri , Lohagad, etc. If someone has to visit any forts then we have been full information about it, you will have to click on the read button after that page will open on that page you will get details of that Maharashtra forts.

 
**2.	OBJECTIVES –**

Some of the key objectives of this project are as follows:

1) In this we give the location of each and every fort.
2) To increase awareness about forts history.
3) User friendly.
4) People should easily search any information of any fort.
5) Time saving – nowadays time is very precious for every person, so this website save the time of visitors which he/she has to spent.
6) We can give the facility to just click once and you can access the list of every fort.

Objective of the project on forts of Maharashtra was to establishing the fort to guard which are conquered from the enemies who attacking either by sea or land. He had built around 240 forts before he die. This was defensive towards war. His methodology was, the forts had massive walls and few men to guard with lots of necessary supplies. His famous 9 forts are Torna, Sinhagad, Raigad, Shivneri, Vijaydurg, Sindhudurg, Rajgad, Pratapgad and Lohagad.

**3.	PRELIMINARY SYSTEM ANALYSIS:-**
		
		This is the stage where the first investigation is been carried out by the developer who actually wants to develop a project. Any person related with the system initiate the request. This problem is investigated in the preliminary investigation. This is the stage where the needs and requirements of the user identifing being investigated and develop a new system as per user requirement. This activity has three parts request certification, feasibility study and request approval.
We have seen various website and we have found that it contains only the information about Maharashtra forts but there are only few websites where gives the information of the kings who reign that fort.

 
**3.1. NEED OF NEW SYSTEM:-**
	
		New system is been prepared keeping in mind that it deals effectively and more flexible than the existing system. New system and technology may allow faster processing. We gave very much information about forts and if visitors want to share his experience so they can easily share in our website which type of data like videos and images he or she can uploaded in our website.

3.2. Feasibility Study:-
The main objective of Feasibility study is to determine whether it is financially and technically possible to develop the system. For the success of any system, testing the capability of the system is called Feasibility Study. This is also like any common software testing. The purpose of feasibility study is not to solve the problem, but to find out whether the problem can be solved or not. Feasibility study helps to understand the overview of the problem. Feasibility study is done to make sure that the project has to go ahead, or it has to be postponed or cancelled. The information of the system is deeply examined and it is determined that how success can be achieved in developing the system. In this, all the problems coming in the system are analyzed and if any kind of problem comes then how it can be solved. Types of Feasibility studies are as under:

3.2.1. Economic Feasibility: - In this feasibility, it is determined that how much time will be spent in the proposed system and how much benefit will be available in it.
3.2.2. Operational Feasibility:- In this feasibility, it is determined that how a proposed system will solve the problems and what kind of changes have come in the system. In this, it is seen whether the system is beneficial for the users or not and whether it is able to meet the needs or not.

3.2.3. Technical Feasibility: - In this feasibility the technical requirement of the system is determined. In this, it is seen that the Technology required for the proposed system is available and how that technology should be integrated into the system.
Technically competent expert people are required to handle all kinds of complexities coming in the new technology.

3.2.4. Legal Feasibility: - During this study, it helps in telling the organization about any project. This project needs legal action or not. Like data protection act or social media laws are needed or not. When an organization has to open an office at a new place. So the company has to see whether it needs legal action or not.

3.2.5. Scheduling Feasibility: - This study is most important for any project. Because if the project is not completed on time then the project can also fail. In this study, any organization does time management for the completion of the project. How long can it take for the project to be completed. This has to be determined.


**3.3 FLAWS IN PRESENT SYSTEM:-**

Monitoring and maintaining your website performance is extremely important. Poor performance in any area can hurt your ability to convert visitors as well as your ability collect reliable data, which is needed to adjust and improve websites.
	
3.3.1. Slow Loading Time: - Slow loading times can absolutely kill the website experience of your visitors.

3.3.2. Presence of Broken Links: - Broken links are links on your site that don’t work, whether they are links directing visitors to a page off your website or that exits on your website.

3.3.3. Problematic Landing Pages: - Landing pages are vital to your ability to converts leads.

3.3.4. Possibilities of Errors: - major difficulties in the present system large possibilities of errors.

3.3.5. Data is not provided: - Required data is not provided on the time and specifications are necessary.

3.3.6. Execution: - Sometime various applications are not executed proper manner.

3.3.7. Accuracy: - Systems now available lacks in accuracy of the data on time and generate manual error.

HTML document are composed entirely of HTML elements that, in their most general from have three components; a pair of element tags, a:"start tag “and “end tags": than some elements attributes within the start tag: and finally any textual and graphical content between the start and end tags. HTML is the language in which must websites are written. HTML is used to create pages and make them functional. The code used to make them visually appealing is known as CSS. The HTML element is everything between and including the tags. Each tag is enclosed in angular brackets. Hypertext markup makes part of document in to links to other document an anchor elements creates a hyperlink in the documents with the here attributes set to the link URL. The vast majority of tags must be opened (<TAG>) and closed (<TAG>) with the clement information such as a title or text resting between the tags. When using multiple lags, the tags must be closed in the order in which they were opened.

2. FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENT
3. NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENT
4. DATABASE DESIGN
5. SYSTEM ARCHTECTURE
6. TESTING AND QUALITY ASSURANCE
7. DOCUMENTATION AND TRAINING
  
  
**8. Implementation, Evaluation and Maintenance:**
8.1. IMPLEMENTATION:
Implementation phase is mainly concerned with the user training, site, and preparation and files conversion. It also involves final testing of the system. During implementation the component build during development are put into optional use.
Following are the points should be considered while doing implementation of the site or application.
	Testing, debugging and documentation program.
	Converting data from old to new system.
	Giving training to the user about how to operate the system.
	Developing operating procedures for the computer operating staff.
	Establishing a maintenance procedure to repair and enhance system.
	Completing documentation.
	Operating system on the user location and solving all the issues occurred while operation.


8.2. EVALUATION:
After the implementation phase another stage in project development is evaluation. After keeping the project in the working condition for the sometime, all the errors that are showing in the computer program should be removed. The programmer needs to correct them so that same error should not be repeated. We should also get the feedback from the user which are using it and ask them whether, it is user friendly or not. After evaluating the program and satisfying the needs of the user the program is maintain fully to give the same functionalities for what it was intended to be. This stage should be implemented so as to regular check-up the errors with error handling techniques. This stage is the updating and correcting of the program to account for changing condition or field experience.

8.3. MAINTENANCE:

Maintenance is the act of regularly checking your website for issues and mistakes and keeping it updated and relevant. This should be done on a consistent basis in order to keep your website healthy, encourage continued traffic growth, and strengthen your SEO and Google rankings. Keeping a website well maintained and attractive is important to companies big and small in order to engage and retain customers. It’s easy for businesses, especially startups, to cut corners and let a few tasks slide.
Website maintenance can easily become one of those things as it doesn’t always present immediate issues. However, just like your health can fall apart if you go too long without a regular check- up, so can the health of your website.
